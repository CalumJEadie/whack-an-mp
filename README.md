Rules
-----

-   You will have 1 minute to 'whack' as many politicians as possible
-   You get 1 point per politician
-   Politicians will appear from the holes, expand and contract and then
    dissapear unless you 'whack' them
-   The speed at which the politicians move is based on how often they
    have voted in Parliment
-   The size that they grow to will depend on how often they speak in
    Parliment

Those politicians that vote regularly and speak in debates often will be
the smallest and quickest to disappear,those politicians that don't vote
or speak regularly... will take a lot of abuse

Score Board
-----------

This is the list of things we'd like the score board to do... if we have
time

-   Show top 10 scores with name
-   Give an overall rank for your score
-   Show the top 3 'whacked' politicians
-   Show the bottom 3 'whacked' politicians
-   Show the players local politicians ranking if they put in their Post
    Code

Disclaimer
----------

*A low voting percentage does not always indicate lack of attendance. An
MP may have a low voting rate because they have abstained, have
ministerial or other duties or they are the speaker*
