    <h2> Rules </h2>
    
    <ul class="text-list">
      <li> You will have 1 minute to 'whack' as many politicians as possible </li>
      <li> You get 1 point per politician </li>
      <li> Politicians will appear from the holes, expand and contract and then dissapear unless you 'whack' them </li>
      <li> The speed at which the politicians move is based on how often they have voted in Parliment </li>
      <li> The size that they grow to will depend on how often they speak in Parliment</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Those politicians that vote regularly and speak in debates often will be the smallest and quickest to disappear,those politicians that don't vote or speak regularly... will take a lot of abuse</p>

    <h2> Score Board </h2>

    <p>This is the list of things we'd like the score board to do... if we have time</p>

    <ul class="text-list">
      <li> Show top 10 scores with name </li>
      <li> Give an overall rank for your score </li>
      <li> Show the top 3 'whacked' politicians </li>
      <li> Show the bottom 3 'whacked' politicians </li>
      <li> Show the players local politicians ranking if they put in their Post Code </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Disclaimer </h2>

    <p><em> A low voting percentage does not always indicate lack of attendance. An MP may have a low voting rate because they have abstained, have ministerial or other duties or they are the speaker</em></p>
