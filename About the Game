<h1> Rules </h1>
<ul>
	<li> You will have 1 minute to 'whack' as many politicians as possible </li>
	<li> You get 1 point per politician </li>
	<li> Politicians will appear from the holes, expand and contract and then dissapear unless you 'whack' them </li>
	<li> The speed at which the politicians move is based on how often they have voted in Parliment </li>
	<li> The size that they grow to will depend on how often they speak in Parliment</li>
</ul>
<p> Those politicians that vote regularly and speak in debates often will be the smallest and quickest to disappear,
those politicians that don't vote or speak regularly... will take a lot of abuse</p>

<h1> Score Board </h1>
